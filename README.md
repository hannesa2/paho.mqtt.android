# MQTT Android Service

The MQTT Android Service is an MQTT client library written in Kotlin.
It has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging
applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).
MQTT reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.

## Using this MQTT Android Client

#### Jitpack.io 

More details are here https://jitpack.io/#hannesa2/paho.mqtt.android

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

```
dependencies {
  implementation "com.github.hannesa2:paho.mqtt.android:$latestVersion"
}
```
## Background behavior

#### Version 4.x doesn't need a foreground service

The main advantages
* it doesn't use `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` which drain the battery
* it uses `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx` to receive messages during device sleep 


#### Version 3.x and Android O foreground service (deprecated)

When you use a version 3.x on Android >= O you should use it as foreground service

```
val client = MqttAndroidClient(context, uri, clientId).apply {
    setForegroundService(foregroundNotification, 3)
}
```
