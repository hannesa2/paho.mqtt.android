     * payable* is a valid topic.
     *  * A leading "/" creates a distinct topic. For example,
     *  finance* is different from *finance*.
     * matches "+/+" and "/+", but not "+".
     *  * Do not include the null character (Unicode *\x0000*) in any topic.
     *
     * The following principles apply to the construction and content of a topic
     * tree:
     *
     *  * The length is limited to 64k but within that there are no limits to
     * the number of levels in a topic tree.
     *  * There can be any number of root nodes; that is, there can be any
     * number of topic trees.

     * Subscribes to multiple topics, each topic may include wildcards.
     *
     * Provides an optimized way to subscribe to multiple topics compared to subscribing to each one individually.
     *
     * The [.setCallback] method should be called before this method, otherwise any received messages will be discarded.
     *
     *  If (@link MqttConnectOptions#setCleanSession(boolean)} was set to true,
     * when connecting to the server, the subscription remains in place until
     * either:
     *
     *  * The client disconnects
     *  * An unsubscribe method is called to unsubscribe the topic
     *
     * If (@link MqttConnectOptions#setCleanSession(boolean)} was set to false,
     * when connecting to the server, the subscription remains in place
     * until either:
     *
     *  * An unsubscribe method is called to unsubscribe the topic
     *  * The next time the client connects with cleanSession set to true
     *
     * With cleanSession set to false the MQTT server will store messages
     * on behalf of the client when the client is not connected. The next time
     * the client connects with the **same client ID** the server will
     * deliver the stored messages to the client.
     *
     * The "topic filter" string is used when subscription may contain special
     * characters, which allows you to subscribe to multiple topics at once.
     * <dl>
     * <dt>Topic level separator</dt>
     * <dd>The forward slash (/) is used to separate each level within a topic
     * tree and provide a hierarchical structure to the topic space. The use of
     * the topic level separator is significant when the two wildcard characters
     * are encountered in topics specified by subscribers.</dd>
    </dl> *
     *
     * <dt>Multi-level wildcard</dt>
     * <dd>
    </dd> *
     *
     * The number sign (#) is a wildcard character that matches any number of
     * levels within a topic. For example, if you subscribe to <span><span class="filepath">finance/stock/ibm/#</span></span>, you receive messages
     * on these topics:
     *
     *  * <pre>finance/stock/ibm</pre>
     *  * <pre>finance/stock/ibm/closingprice</pre>
     *  * <pre>finance/stock/ibm/currentprice</pre>
     *
     * The multi-level wildcard can represent zero or more levels. Therefore,
     * *finance/#* can also match the singular *finance*, where
     * *#* represents zero levels. The topic level separator is
     * meaningless in this context, because there are no levels to separate.
     *
     * The <span>multi-level</span> wildcard can be specified only on its own or
     * next to the topic level separator character. Therefore, *#* and
     * *finance/#* are both valid, but *finance#* is not valid.
     * <span>The multi-level wildcard must be the last character used within the
     * topic tree. For example, *finance/#* is valid but
     * *finance/#/closingprice* is not valid.</span>
     *
     * <dt>Single-level wildcard</dt>
     * <dd>
    </dd> *
     *
     * The plus sign (+) is a wildcard character that matches only one topic
     * level. For example, *finance/stock/+* matches
     * *finance/stock/ibm* and *finance/stock/xyz*, but not
     * *finance/stock/ibm/closingprice*. Also, because the single-level
     * wildcard matches only a single level, *finance/+* does not match
     * *finance*.
     *
     * Use the single-level wildcard at any level in the topic tree, and in
     * conjunction with the multilevel wildcard. Specify the single-level
     * wildcard next to the topic level separator, except when it is specified
     * on its own. Therefore, *+* and *finance/+* are both valid,
     * but *finance+* is not valid. <span>The single-level wildcard can
     * be used at the end of the topic tree or within the topic tree. For
     * example, *finance/+* and *finance/+/ibm* are both
     * valid.</span>
     *
     * The method returns control before the subscribe completes. Completion can
     * be tracked by:
     *
     *  * Waiting on the supplied token [MqttToken.waitForCompletion]
     * or
     *  * Passing in a callback [IMqttActionListener] to this method
